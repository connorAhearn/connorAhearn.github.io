            <p>After graduating high school, due to my interest in aviation I decided to chase my then dream of

            <h1>Career Summary</h1>
            My name is Connor Ahearn, and I am a 3rd year Software Engineering Student. Alongside my studies in pursuit
            of my degree, I have been developing the skills required in the industry to be a <strong> Full Stack
                Developer</strong>. So far, I have a strong understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am
            also very familiar with Java, C#, Unix, C and Node.js. </p>
            <p>My professional background is primarily in the Canadian Armed Forces and Aviation. I was employed there
                as an Air
                Force Officer training as a Pilot for 3 years before changing careers. The military taught me a great
                deal of Leadership and Time Management skills, along with the proper training to deal with intense,
                complex problems underpressure. Throughout my time in the Forces, I was always thrown into new
                environments with little preparation, and was expected to adapt and overcome the challenges that
                awaited me. </p>
            <p>I've moved on from this past career to Software because I love the reach that our industry has. The
                basic idea behind all of my career choices has been that I want to always be working toward a better
                world, and to be making people's lives better. Software's fast design cycle, the way it scales along
                with the speed that and idea can go from concept to implementation are all reasons I felt drawn to this
                field. </p>
