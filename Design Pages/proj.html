            <h2>FancyClock</h2>
            <h3>Webpage / Hardware Project (Eventually!)</h3>
            <p>When I was shopping once in downtown Toronto one day I saw what I thought was the coolest clock I had
                ever seen. It used words lighting up instead of numbers or hands to tell you the time, and I thought it
                was so unique, I had to have it. Then when I checked the price tag, I saw it was over $1000. A little
                too much for a clock in my opinion. I figured I could probably make this clock with my Raspberry Pi and
                some fancy LEDs. I modeled it with a webpage, and I'm in the process of finding the right materials to
                replicate it myself.</p>
            <h3>Skills Used:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML, CSS</li>
                <li>JavaScript DOM editing over time</li>
                <li>Node.js to control LEDs (Eventually!)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>WeatherBox</h2>
            <h3>Hardware Project / Pulling data from RESTful API</h3>
            <p>Every morning in Fall / Winter I check the temperature for the day and decide which coat I should wear.
                I wanted to have a device where I clicked a button and it would flat out tell me what to wear or bring
                for the weather. I pulled weather data off the web and used it to light up LEDs according to specific
                conditions. In the end, it was a fun project but it didn't really save me much time, so I don't use it
                anymore.</p>
