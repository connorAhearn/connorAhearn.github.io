            <h1>Career Aspirations</h1>
            <p>
                Coming into my third year of Engineering, my career is still young and I'm open to new experiences. I
                loved my time doing Web Development this past summer, but I'd also love to see more of the technology
                industry with my next occupation. One aspect that I'm searching for with future employment is
                mentorship from experienced workers in my field. While working on my own last summer was fun and was a
                great opportunity, I'd like to round out my work experience somewhere where I'm part of a larger
                development team.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end of the day though, I'm open to any workspace, as I'm very well trained in being a part of a
                team and working with my peers to accomplish common goals.
