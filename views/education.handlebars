        <h3>Web Development - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Wordpress</h3>
        <p>In the world of Web Development, I'd consider myself self-taught. I've accomplished this through a
            variety of textbooks, Youtube tutorials, some Coursera lectures and some personal projects here and
            there. I also have some work experience in this field from when I worked at MonstrARTity.</p>

        <h3>Object Oriented Programming - Java, C#</h3>
        <p>My Software Engineering degree has been predominantly taught in Java. Any data structures, design
            projects and assignments for my degree have all used Java. To further understand Object Oriented
            Programming, the summer following first year I taught myself C# through textbooks and YouTube videos,
            and I have a project on my old GitHub using it</p>
