        <h2>FancyClock</h2>
        <h3>Webpage / Hardware Project (Eventually!)</h3>
        <p>When I was shopping once in downtown Toronto one day I saw what I thought was the coolest clock I had
            ever seen. It used words lighting up instead of numbers or hands to tell you the time, and I thought it
            was so unique, I had to have it. Then when I checked the price tag, I saw it was over $1000. A little
            too much for a clock in my opinion. I figured I could probably make this clock with my Raspberry Pi and
            some fancy LEDs. I modeled it with a webpage, and I'm in the process of finding the right materials to
            replicate it myself.</p>

        <h2>WeatherBox</h2>
        <h3>Hardware Project / Pulling data from RESTful API</h3>
        <p>Every morning in Fall / Winter I check the temperature for the day and decide which coat I should wear.
            I wanted to have a device where I clicked a button and it would flat out tell me what to wear or bring
            for the weather. I pulled weather data off the web and used it to light up LEDs according to specific
            conditions. In the end, it was a fun project but it didn't really save me much time, so I don't use it
            anymore.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pulled data from OpenWeatherMap RESTful API</li>
            <li>Activated LEDs on a Raspberry Pi using Node.js</li>
            <li>Transferred and ran code between my laptop and Raspberry Pi using Git and SSH</li>
        </ul>
